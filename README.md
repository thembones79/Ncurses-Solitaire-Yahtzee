# ncurses-solitaire-yahtzee
Yet another Yahtzee repo to teach myself ncurses in C

This program requires the non-standard ncurses library to be installed either on Linux or Cygwin terminal in Windows

To compile this code with LLVM in Linux use the command 'clang -lncurses sy.c'
To compile this code with LLVM in Cygwin use the command 'clang sy.c -lncurses'
